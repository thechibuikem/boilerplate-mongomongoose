# Overview

This is a MongoDB and Mongoose learning project from freeCodeCamp's APIs and Microservices curriculum. The application serves as a boilerplate for completing MongoDB/Mongoose challenges, focusing on database operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents through a schema-based ODM (Object-Document Mapper). The project uses Express.js for the web server framework and is designed as an educational exercise for learning database interactions with MongoDB.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Backend Architecture

**Node.js/Express Server**
- Uses Express.js as the web framework for handling HTTP requests
- Entry point is `server.js` which sets up routes and middleware
- Application logic resides in `myApp.js` where MongoDB operations are implemented
- Body-parser middleware handles JSON and URL-encoded request bodies
- CORS is configured to allow requests from freeCodeCamp.org domains

**Database Layer (MongoDB with Mongoose)**
- Mongoose ODM (v5.11.15) provides schema-based modeling for MongoDB
- Connection string stored in environment variable `MONGO_URI` for security
- Connection uses modern MongoDB driver options (`useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`)
- Person model/schema needs to be defined (currently placeholder)
- Implements callback-based async patterns for database operations

**Data Operations Pattern**
- All database functions follow a callback pattern with `done(error, data)` signature
- Functions are stubbed out for completion:
  - `createAndSavePerson` - Single document creation
  - `createManyPeople` - Bulk document insertion
  - `findPeopleByName` - Query by name field
  - `findOneByFood` - Single document query by food preference
  - `findPersonById` - Query by MongoDB _id
  - `findEditThenSave` - Find, modify, and save pattern
  - `findAndUpdate` - Atomic find and update operation

**Environment Configuration**
- Uses `dotenv` package to load environment variables from .env file
- Validates `MONGO_URI` presence before attempting connection
- Provides user-friendly error messages for configuration issues

## Frontend Architecture

**Static HTML Interface**
- Minimal single-page interface (`views/index.html`)
- Served from Express static file middleware
- Basic styling with centered layout
- No client-side JavaScript framework required
- Designed for programmatic testing rather than user interaction

## Error Handling & Security

**Connection Safety**
- Graceful handling of missing MongoDB connection string
- Try-catch wrapper for mongoose import failures
- Connection error handling with descriptive console messages
- 10-second timeout configured for callback operations to prevent hanging

**Request Security**
- CORS restrictions limit cross-origin requests
- Environment-based origin whitelisting
- `.env` file access blocked through routing middleware
- Security-conscious defaults for production deployment

# External Dependencies

## Database
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL document database (connection required via MONGO_URI)
- **Mongoose** (v5.11.15) - MongoDB ODM for Node.js providing schema validation and query building

## Web Framework
- **Express** (v4.12.4) - Minimal web application framework for Node.js
- **body-parser** (v1.15.2) - Middleware for parsing request bodies

## Configuration & Utilities
- **dotenv** (v8.2.0) - Loads environment variables from .env file into process.env
- **nodemon** (v3.1.10) - Development tool for auto-restarting server on file changes (dev dependency)

## Required Environment Variables
- `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB connection string (required for database connectivity)
- `DISABLE_XORIGIN` - Optional flag to disable CORS restrictions
- `XORIGIN_RESTRICT` - Optional flag to enable stricter origin checking
